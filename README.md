Introduction

This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set”.

Dataset: Electric power consumption [20MB]

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
Loading the data

When loading the dataset into R, the following to be considered:

The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R should be calculated. Computer should have enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).

We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.

It may be useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.

In this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

Making Plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Our task is to construct the plots using the base plotting system.

fh <- file("household_power_consumption.txt")
ba <- read.table(text = grep("^[1,2]/2/2007", readLines(fh), value = TRUE), col.names = c("Date", "Time", "Global_active_power", "Global_reactive_power", "Voltage", "Global_intensity", "Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"), sep = ";", header = TRUE)

# Generating Plot 1
hist(ba$Global_active_power, col = "red", main = paste("Global Active Power"), xlab = "Global Active Power (kilowatts)")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1

## Getting full dataset
data_full <- read.csv("household_power_consumption.txt", header = T, sep = ';', 
                      na.strings = "?", nrows = 2075259, check.names = F, 
                      stringsAsFactors = F, comment.char = "", quote = '\"')
data_full$Date <- as.Date(data_full$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")

## Subsetting the data
data <- subset(data_full, subset = (Date >= "2007-02-01" & Date <= "2007-02-02"))
rm(data_full)

## Converting dates
datetime <- paste(as.Date(data$Date), data$Time)
data$Datetime <- as.POSIXct(datetime)

## Generating Plot 2
plot(data$Global_active_power ~ data$Datetime, type = "l",
     ylab = "Global Active Power (kilowatts)", xlab = "")
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1

## Generating Plot 3
with(data, {
    plot(Sub_metering_1 ~ Datetime, type = "l", 
    ylab = "Global Active Power (kilowatts)", xlab = "")
    lines(Sub_metering_2 ~ Datetime, col = 'Red')
    lines(Sub_metering_3 ~ Datetime, col = 'Blue')
})
legend("topright", col = c("black", "red", "blue"), lty = 1, lwd = 2, 
       legend = c("Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"))
plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1

## Generating Plot 4
par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = c(4,4,2,1), oma = c(0,0,2,0))
with(data, {
     plot(Global_active_power ~ Datetime, type = "l", 
     ylab = "Global Active Power", xlab = "")
     plot(Voltage ~ Datetime, type = "l", ylab = "Voltage", xlab = "datetime")
     plot(Sub_metering_1 ~ Datetime, type = "l", ylab = "Energy sub metering",
          xlab = "")
     lines(Sub_metering_2 ~ Datetime, col = 'Red')
     lines(Sub_metering_3 ~ Datetime, col = 'Blue')
     legend("topright", col = c("black", "red", "blue"), lty = 1, lwd = 2, 
             bty = "n",
             legend = c("Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"))
     plot(Global_reactive_power ~ Datetime, type = "l", 
          ylab = "Global_rective_power", xlab = "datetime")
})
